The basic Consept idea:

ToDo List:
- [x] List files in directory
- [x] CMD and Powershell Buttons
- [x] Moving blurred background
- [x] Navigate
- [x] Open Files
- [ ] Context Menu strip
- [ ] settings
- [ ] Root Mode
- [ ] Copy Past
- [ ] Sidebar
- [ ] Preview Panel
- [ ] Working file browser
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Split View
### Moving blurred background
A blured background (as seen in the image that changes as you move the window accross a screen), this is just to make it look nice, modern and less scary.
(Works best with one screen)
### Split view/Tabs
Split view is having two diffrent directorys open in the same window (like in ![filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/client_screenshots.php)).
Tabs is having multiple diffrent directorys tabbed instead of diffrent windows. Like web browsers have but for a file browsers.
These two are common in most other File Browsers.

## Who is this for
For new developers that are not powerusers of the Default File Browser File Explore.
At the moment it is not ready as it is still in Alpha.
Once in beta it will have most of the features (the common features) that File Explore has with a few more like tabs and split view.

## Why do i need a better File Browser
Better Productivity and more cusomizeability.
